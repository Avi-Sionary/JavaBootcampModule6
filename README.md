Summative Project 1: Console Applications

## Exercise 1: Month Converter

Converts a user-entered number into a month. One version uses an if-else/else-if structure and the other uses a switch statement. Solution consists of the following two files:

### MonthConverterIf

### MonthConverterSwitch

Both programs: 

1. Prompt the user to enter a number between 1 and 12.

2. Print out the name of the month corresponding to its number.

3. Print out the following error message if the user enters a number less than 1 or greater than 12: "You have entered an invalid number. You must enter a number between 1 and 12. Goodbye."

## Exercise 2: Array Fun

Consists of different array-related programs. Specifically:

### ArrayFunUserArray

The console reads five integers from the user, puts them in an array, and prints the array elements to the screen.

### ArrayFunReverselt

The program declares the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], creates another array of equal length, and fills that array with values from the original array but in reverse order. Finally, both arrays are printed to the screen.

### ArrayFun5Words

The user gets five words from the user, puts them in an array, and prints the array elements to the screen.
